<h1>Amour Alliyah </h1>

<h2>Loving Life Unconditionally!</h2>

<p>So I’m getting married!! And because I’m extra, my fiancé and I (mostly me) created a website for our guest to keep updates and links to our registry.<a href= "https://www.zola.com/wedding/lawversandfriends"> lawversandfriends</a></p>


<p>I am literally obsessed with French language and France altogether. I studied it for 8 years (high school + College) and minored in French in my undergrad degree. I spent a whole month in France by myself during January 2019 and got to see the most amazing places on Earth.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise that I love French macarons and crêpes. Coming down to carbondale for school I was excited to know their is a little shop that sells crêpes and tea.<a href= "https://www.facebook.com/blendteaandcrepe/ "> Blended</a></p>  

<p>My favorite french artist is Stromae, and it’s how I can still retain the language after graduating.</p>

<p>After seeing this video, I wanted to do more in the internet world and create a dialog of protesting against human trafficking. Applying for my masters and graduating in December, I am to work in a non-profit that works to create change. I love how social media influences and inspires people and working in adverting and marketing will allow me to generate a voice for the voiceless.  </p>
