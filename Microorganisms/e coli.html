                <em>Escherichia coli </em>is a member of the family <em>Enterobacteriaceae </em>, which are Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods (possessing both a fermentative and respiratory metabolism) and do not produce the enzyme oxidase. <em>Escherichia coli </em>cells are typically 1.1–1.5 μm wide by 2–6 μm long and occur as single straight rods. They can be either motile or nonmotile, and when motile produce lateral, rather than polar flagella. In addition to flagella, many strains produce fimbriae or pili, which are proteinaceous structures (or appendages or fibres) that extend outwards from the bacterial surface and play a role in attachment of the cells to other cells or to host tissues.
