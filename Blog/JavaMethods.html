                    Java is an object oriented programming language where all source code must
                    be written within a class. In these classes, you will often write methods 
                    that do specific tasks. Every method has something called a signature.
                    This is what will tell the programmer the scope, the return type, the name,
                    and the specific parameters that need to be passed into the method.

                    Why are methods important?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Methods are important because, as software developers, we need ways
                    to keep track of the details of every method we write. This will ensure that we 
                    maintain good practices when writing a program, such as keeping certain data private
                    and keeping other data as public.
