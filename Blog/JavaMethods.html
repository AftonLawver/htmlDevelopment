                    Java is an object oriented programming language where all source code must
                    be written within a class. In these classes, you will often write methods 
                    that do specific tasks. Every method has a specific syntax that must be followed for the program to be compiled correctly.
                    This syntax is what will tell the programmer the scope, the return type, the name,
                    and the specific parameters that need to be passed into the method for it to function correctly.

                <h3>
                    Why are methods important?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Methods are important because, as software developers, we will write algorithms to accomplish a certain task. This algorithm can be housed/stored within a method. This way, when we need to do that certain task again, we can just call that method instead of writing the specific algorithm again. As developers, we need a firm understanding of the components of each method we write. This will ensure that we 
                    maintain good practices when writing a program, such as keeping certain data or methods private
                    and keeping other data or methods as public. We will learn more about these terms in the next section.

                <h3>
                    What are the components of a method ?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Methods have a few main components to them that every developer must know. For example, take a look at this method below. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            access modifier
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            return type
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            name of the method
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            list of parameters
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
